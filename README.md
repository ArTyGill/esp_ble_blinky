ESP-IDF BLE BLINKY Demo
===============================================


Compatible with the application for android and ios from Nordic Semiconductor "NRF BLINKY".

This demo for ESP32 shows how to create a GATT service with an attribute table defined in one place, notifications and gpio config. Provided API releases the user from adding attributes one by one as implemented in BLUEDROID. A demo of the other method to create the attribute table is presented in [gatt_server_demo](../gatt_server).

Please check the tutorial(#TODO) for more information about this example.
